# Sorted-Tree
Java and C implementation of a Sorted Tree data structure

Project Description: A Sorted Tree is a binary search tree in which the key is a string and the value is a linked list. The purpose of this is to create categories or "divisions" in which to store a list of things. The key of the tree acts as the category name, and the value is the list of objects within that category. This is designed to potentialy increase efficiency of searching through an ordered set of things, as the categories are sorted alphabetically within the tree
This project has been implemented in both Java and C, with benefits and drawbacks associated with each
This is an independent, personal project, and is not affiliated with the University of Maryland or any other organization or individual. The project concept and implementation is mine, and all code is written by me, using knowledge obtained by the University of Maryland and independent studies
